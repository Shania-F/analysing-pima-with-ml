# analysing-pima-with-ml
applying visualisation and ml to pima dataset from kaggle

First, we describe the dataset and its various attributes, using visualisation tools such as histograms and seaborn plots.

We then train a Decision Tree classifier, and use ML to predict the 'Outcome' variable. The accuracy on training data is 95% and 72% on test data.
This result is illustrated with a confusion matrix and colour map.
